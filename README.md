# EcoLens_Material-Checker
EcoLens is a smart web application that uses generative AI to analyze and classify the environmental sustainability of materials from a single image.  Users can upload a photo or capture a new one with their device camera, and the app's AI-driven backend will instantly identify the material and provide a detailed report on its environmental impact.
